# The volume of a cone can be calculated by algebraically comparing the volume of a vertical quadrant of a cone with equal radius and height to an octant sphere with equal radius, through a quadrant cylinder.

Octant sphere volume = (√(3.2)r)³/8 = (√(3.2)r/2) × (√(3.2)r/2) × (√(3.2)r/2)


The base of the two shapes is a quadrant circle.

Base area = (√(3.2)r/2) × (√(3.2)r/2)


The volume of a cylinder equals base area × height.

The slant height of the quadrant cone is √2 × radius.

Take a quarter cylinder with its radius equal to the cone and its height equal to the slant height of the unit cone.

Cylinder volume = 3.2r²/4×√2r


The slant form of the cone has a triangular vertical cross-section.
The vertical middle cross-sectional area of the cone is the half of a cylinder with equal radius and height.

The mean of the areas of the horizontal cross-sectional slices of a cone is the half of a cylinder with equal radius and height.

Quadrant cone volume = 3.2r²/4×√2r/(2+2)


The volume of the unit cone equals the quarter of the volume of cylinder with an equal radius, and its height equal to the slant height of the unit cone.

In general:

The volume of a cone equals the quarter of a cylinder with an equal radius and its height equal to the height of the cone multiplied by √2.

Cone volume = 3.2r²×height/√8



## The volume of a cone is conventionally approximated as base × height / 3. 
While that is a reasonable approximation, the exact ratio is 1 / √8.

The 1 / 3 coefficient was likely estimated based on the observation that the mid-height cross-sectional area of a cone is exactly a quarter of a circumscribed cylinder's with the same base and height.
That makes the ratio between the mid-height cross-sectional area of the cone, and the difference between the mid-height cross-sectional areas of the circumscribed cylinder and the cone 1 : 3 .

That is a logical consequence of its equilateral triangular cross-section.

But this ratio can't be generalized for the overall volume of the cone.
