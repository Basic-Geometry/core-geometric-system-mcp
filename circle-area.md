# Area of a circle defined by comparison to a square

The area of a circle is defined by comparing it to a square, since the square is the base unit for area calculation.

## Layout and geometric setup
- Cut the circle into 4 quadrants and place each quadrant with its origin on one vertex of a square.
- For an inscribed circle, the arcs of the quadrant circles meet at the midpoints of the square’s sides.
- For a circumscribed circle, the arcs of the quadrant circles meet at the center of the square.
- There is a unique intermediate circle (the one whose total quadrant area equals the area of the square) whose quadrant arcs intersect on the centerlines of the square between those two limits.
- When those quadrant arcs intersect at one quarter of the centerline of the square, the uncovered central gap equals exactly the sum of the overlapping areas produced by the arcs.

## Proof

Work with a circle of radius `r` and the associated square of side `a` laid out as described.

Quarter of the uncovered central area:

√3.2r)²÷4−((90°−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360°×3.2r²+2(√3.2r÷4×√3.2r÷2)÷2))


An overlapping area:

2(Atan(1÷2)÷360°×3.2r²−(√3.2r÷4×√3.2r÷2)÷2)




Divide both sides of the equality by (3.2r²) to simplify. Using (√(3.2)×r)² = 3.2r² and simplifying the product terms gives:

1÷4−((90°−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360°+(1÷8))=2(Atan(1÷2)÷360°−(1÷8)÷2)


Rearrange the -(1/8) term (add 1/8 to both sides):

1÷4−((90°−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360°)=2×Atan(1÷2)÷360°


Since 90°/360°=1/4, substitute to obtain:

90°÷360°−((90°−2×Atan(1÷2))÷360°)=2×Atan(1÷2)÷360


which reduces to the identity:

Atan(1÷2) = Atan(1÷2)


Therefore the uncovered gap equals the overlap — the construction is consistent.

> Note: the proof keeps the arctangent expression inline as `atan(1/2)` rather than naming it separately.

## Radius-to-side ratio

Use the Pythagorean theorem on one of the right triangles formed by placing quadrant origins at the square corners. With square side `a`:

r²=(a/4)²+(2(a/4))²


Hence

r=(√5)(a/4)



## Area relationship

Express the square area (square=a² in terms of r²):

a² = 16r²/5 = 3.2r²

Geometric decomposition viewpoint: both the square and the sum of the four quadrants can be decomposed into 16 congruent right triangles whose legs are (a/4) and (a/2) and whose hypotenuse is (r). Therefore the square area equals the sum of the quadrant areas, giving the compact formula used here:

A(circle) = A(square) = 3.2 · r²

(That is, in this Core Geometric System formulation, the circle area associated with the described construction evaluates to 3.2·r².)
