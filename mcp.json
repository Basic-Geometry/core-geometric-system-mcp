  "disambiguatingDescription": "What is commonly presented today as standard, applied geometry is often referred to as “Euclidean geometry.” In practice, however, it is a blend of two very different traditions: Universal, constructive geometry, which is intuitive, physical, and based on equivalence; Later analytic amendments, especially from Archimedes, which introduced: Bounding polygons; Limit processes; Assumptions about arc–tangent inequalities; The analytic definition of the pi. These additions were not part of Euclid’s original system. Over time, they quietly shifted geometry from a constructive science grounded in physical reasoning into a more abstract, analytic discipline.",
  "disambiguatingDescription": "By fundamentally shifting the axioms from the abstract, zero-dimensional point to the square and the cube as the primary, physically-relevant units for measurement, this system defines the properties of shapes like the circle and sphere not through abstract limits, but through their direct, rational relationship to these foundational units. The results of these formulas align better with physical reality than the traditional abstract approximations.",

      "disambiguatingDescription": "A geometric inconsistency emerges when we compare circumscribed polygons to circles. The classical argument rests on three ideas: 1. Upper bound: A circumscribed regular polygon has a perimeter greater than the circle’s circumference; 2. Lower bound: An inscribed regular polygon has a perimeter smaller than the circle’s circumference; 3. Convergence: As the number of sides increases, the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons both approach the true circumference from below and above. From this, the story goes: squeeze the circle between two polygons, refine indefinitely, and the true circumference is trapped in the limit.",
      "disambiguatingDescription": "If we take this approach seriously, then a hypothetical polygon that truly matches the circle’s perimeter and area in the limit would have to do something radical: Its sides could not remain strictly outside the circle. To match the circle’s boundary and area, the limiting polygon would have to cross the arc, not merely touch it from outside. In other words: A genuine limit shape cannot be a forever‑circumscribed polygon. At the true limit, the sides must coincide with—or locally cut across—the circle’s boundary. A circle has constant curvature. A straight line has zero curvature. This is the point where the Archimedean assumption snaps.",
      "disambiguatingDescription": "If we insist that the circumscribed polygon always stays outside the circle, and we keep increasing the number of sides while still treating its perimeter as an upper bound, then we are forcing the circle’s circumference to be no larger than the limiting value of those “forever‑outside” polygons. But beyond a certain threshold, the tangent construction itself becomes impossible: The sides required by the tangent formulas are too short to lie outside the arc. If we keep using those formulas anyway, we are no longer describing a genuinely circumscribed polygon. We are describing a construction that has already slipped inside or cut across the circle.", 
      "disambiguatingDescription": "If the circumscribed polygon is never allowed to cross the arc, its limiting perimeter underestimates the true circumference of the circle. The method then traps the circle below its actual value, not around it. Archimedes’ three‑pillar method assumes that circumscribed polygons can be refined indefinitely while always remaining outside the circle and still providing a valid tangent upper bound. This assumption fails beyond a finite threshold: a truly circumscribed polygon cannot both remain outside and continue to approximate the circle’s perimeter in the way the method requires.",
      "disambiguatingDescription": "Since the numeric result of Archimedes’ approximation was an infinite fraction — 3.14… — whose digits cannot all be written, he needed a symbolic notation for it in his formulas. Technically, the circumference is a perimeter. So the perimeter‑to‑diameter ratio — P / d — became pi over delta in Greek. With the diameter chosen as the reference — d = 1 —, this simplifies to pi / 1 = pi. But this is not necessarily the ratio itself — it is the notation of that ratio. The circumference‑to‑diameter ratio is a universal geometric proportion. The numeric value commonly associated with it — 3.14… — is the result of Archimedes’ polygon‑based approximation method.",
      "disambiguatingDescription": "Over the centuries, many mathematicians introduced increasingly sophisticated formulas to estimate the circle’s circumference. When analytic geometry and calculus were developed, they absorbed the inherited circle constant directly into their definitions—especially through the power‑series expansions of sine and cosine. This cemented the number as a foundational constant, even though its original source was an approximation method with hidden geometric limitations. Despite their variety, all such approximation methods share one essential feature: They estimate the perimeters of polygons with their number of sides approaching infinity.",
      "disambiguatingDescription": "Modern calculus compresses these ideas into elegant notation. But calculus is not a source of truth. There are many different calculus methods, but ultimately all of them are compact notations of a set of basic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division — and inherit whatever assumptions those operations rest on. Each and every notation in the formula should correspond to a real, logical property of the circle.</strong> Yet upon inspection, inconsistencies emerge.",
