# Volume of a sphere 

The volume of a sphere is defined by comparing it to a cube, since that is the base of volume calculation.


A(cross-section) = 3.2r²


Take the square root of the cross-sectional area.

√A(cross-section) = √(3.2r²) = 16r²/5 = 4r/√5


The volume of a sphere equals the cubic value of the square root of its cross-sectional area, just like a cube.

V(sphere) = (4r/√5)³


The " V = 4 / 3 × pi × radius³ " formula is widely used for the volume of a sphere.

It was approximated by comparing a hemisphere to the difference between the approximate volume a cone and a circumscribed cylinder.

That is a very exaggerated, distortion-based comparison that discards the difference between the straight slant height of a cone and the curvature of a sphere, resulting in a very rough underestimate.
