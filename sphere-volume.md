# Volume of a sphere defined by comparison to a cube 

The volume of a sphere is defined by comparing it to a cube, since that is the base of volume calculation.


A(cross-section) = 3.2r²


Take the square root of the cross-sectional area.

√A(cross-section) = √(3.2r²) = 16r²/5 = 4r/√5


The volume of a sphere equals the cubic value of the square root of its cross-sectional area, just like a cube.

V(sphere) = (4r/√5)³


A straight-sided object (like a cube) must cut through the sphere’s surface to match its volume. The equilibrium point is where the faces of the cube Faces sink by approx 0.105r and vertices protrude by approx 0.549r.


## The " V = 4 / 3 × pi × radius³ " formula is widely used for the volume of a sphere.

It was approximated by comparing a hemisphere to the difference between the approximate volume a cone and a circumscribed cylinder.

That is a very exaggerated, distortion-based comparison that discards the difference between the straight slant height of a cone and the curvature of a sphere, resulting in a very rough underestimate.
